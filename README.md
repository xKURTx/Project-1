## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to answer three business questions:

1. What are the most popular destinations based on neighborhood?
2. What are the most popular listings?
3. What are the most expensive neighborhoods?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one Jupyter Notebook.  

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data?select=listings.csv).
